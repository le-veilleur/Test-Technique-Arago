# ‚úÖ Pros

* Use of Docker and Docker Compose
* Effort made toward a clean architecture

# ‚ùå Cons

* No `Makefile` or similar automation tool to simplify common tasks
* Use of French in the README and codebase, which may hinder accessibility for non-French speakers
* Duplicate generation of `pb.go` files
* Codebase is difficult to navigate due to complex structure
* Redundant `docker-compose` files
* No unit tests or bench tests

# üìù Conclusion

* The test is functional, but the clean architecture feels unnecessarily heavy for the size and scope of the project.
* Consider simplifying the structure and improving developer ergonomics with a `Makefile`, consistent naming, and clearer organization.
